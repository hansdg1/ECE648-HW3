Image Sampling and Quantization
# Procedure Details
## Image
1. Read the 8-bit image [lena.bmp](lena.bmp) of size 256 x 256. (_imread_)
2. Downsample the image by a factor of 2 to size 128 x 128. 
  1. Display and print the original and downsampled image after converting it back into 256 x 256 size image by row and column duplication, i.e, upsample by a factor of 2. (_image, colormap, axis_)
3. Downsample the image by a factor of 4 to size 64 x 64. 
  1. Display and print the original and downsampled image after converting it back into 256 x 256 size image by row and column duplication, i.e, upsample by a factor of 4.
4. Downsample the image by a factor of 8 to size 32 x 32. 
  1. Display and print the original and downsampled image after converting it back into 256 x 256 size image by row and column duplication, i.e, upsample by a factor of 8.
5. Display and print the original and sampled images on the same page.
6. Quantize the pixels of the 256 x 256 size image to 4 bits/pixel.
7. Quantize the pixels of the 256 x 256 size image to 2 bits/pixel.
8. Quantize the pixels of the 256 x 256 size image to 1 bits/pixel (binary image).
9. Display and print the original and quantized images on the same page.

## Write-Up
1. Cover sheet
2. Print out of all lena images.
3. Comment on the quality of downsampled and quantized images.
4. Conclusions or summary.
5. Listing of the MATLAB programs.
